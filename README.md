## üí° Problem Statement

AICTE receives a high volume of queries from various stakeholders such as students, teachers, organizations, and administrators. Many users face difficulties due to lack of information, critical data blocks, or accessibility challenges (visual, auditory, or speech impairments). This project aims to streamline the query process using an intelligent chatbot.
